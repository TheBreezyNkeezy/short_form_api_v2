The Electrified GV70 (a name of which we are not fond, since "electrified" usually implies partial electrification of the powertrain, such as a hybrid, while "electric" means an all-electric car) doesn't ride the dedicated E-GMP platform that underpins the Genesis GV60, Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6. And while the gas GV70 has a spare tire under the cargo floor, the electric version uses that space for, er, electric stuff. When we first drove the Electrified G80, we noted that the driving characteristics were largely the same as the gas car, and we expect the Electrified GV70 will mimic the driving dynamics we've enjoyed on the internal-combustion version. Stateside assembly is one criteria the GV70 must meet to qualify for the revised Federal EV tax credit; the others involve the content and assembly of the battery (still an unknown, at least to us) and price, which, for SUVs, must be under $80,000. The back seat feels somewhat tighter; Genesis told us to expect a slight reduction in interior dimensions, something we've already noted in the Electrified G80 as compared to the gas-powered model. Rather, it is literally an electric version of the gasoline GV70, as is the Electrified G80 sedan, though Hyundai insists the architecture was designed with battery power in mind.
